//Dynamic memory allocation
/*
An statically  allocated variable or array has a fixed size in memory.
We have learnt to create big enough array to fit in our inputs but its doesn't seem like an optimal way to allocate memory.

clearly we need a way to request memory on runtime.

dynamic memory allocation is a way in which the size of a data structure can be changed during the runtime. and make it free also after use.
allocation is done during the program's execution
there is memeory reusability and the allocated memory can be free when not required

/*
Memory allocation in c programs

Memory assigned to  a program in a typical architecture can be broken down into four segments

1- code= text segment
2- Static/global variable.
i-data segement (intialized segment)
ii- bss segment (uninitialized segment)

3- Stack== like LIFO last in first out jo last me dala wo pahle niklega

4 - heap(dynamic memory allocation)
